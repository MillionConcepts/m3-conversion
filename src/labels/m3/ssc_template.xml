        These are empirically-derived smoothing curves used in L1B calibration.
        No labels or format specifications are given for these files, so we have
        retained them as-is and simply labeled them as text documents. However,
        it is likely that they can be transparently interpreted as fixed-width
        tables. These curves are referenced in the PDS4 labels of their
        associated observations, and also share a filename stem. From the DPSIS:
        "These curves were used as the final step in the Level 1B spectral
        radiance calibration. For each image cube, the detector temperature
        measured during data acquisition is used to identify the appropriate
        correction gain factor and every spectrum in the image cube is
        multiplied by the gain curve applicable to that temperature. For the
        Target data, the smooth curves of Figure 2-19 were interpolated to the
        Target wavelengths."
